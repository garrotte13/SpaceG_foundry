[mod-setting-name]
bzfoundry-recipe-bypass=Bypass recipes
bzfoundry-smelt=Foundry can smelt
bzfoundry-plates=Add refractory recipes (experimental)
bzfoundry-hydrocarbon=Hydrocarbon for founding
bzfoundry-other-machines=Other machines that can do founding
bzfoundry-minimal=Minimal mode (remove buildings)

[mod-setting-description]
bzfoundry-recipe-bypass=Skip modifying these recipes (comma-separated list).
bzfoundry-smelt=If true, the foundry building can also handle raw ore smelting.
bzfoundry-hydrocarbon=Which hydrocarbon to use for founding. The foundry building is also used for coking.\nIf [color=cyan]coke[/color], a coke item and recipe is added, if needed.\nIf [color=cyan]solid fuel[/color], an early but inefficient recipe is added.\nIf [color=cyan]coal[/color], that is used.\nIf [color=cyan]none[/color], no hydrocarbon is used in founding (not recommended).
bzfoundry-other-machines=List of other "assembling-machine" entities that can do "founding" recipes. Eg. Krastorio2's "kr-advanced-furnace", or AAII's "industrial-furnace" (comma-separated list).
bzfoundry-plates=[color=orange]EXPERIMENTAL[/color] Ingredients, products, or anything might change.\nUsing one or more refractories, foundries can increase output of plates.\nBe warned, these are complex recipes.
bzfoundry-minimal=[color=yellow]Use with caution![/color]\nIntended as a workaround for Factorio's required mod dependency system. Disables foundry buildings and recipe changes that rely on them. Allows you to play without Foundry with Aluminum, while still letting Foundry be a required dependency with default mod settings.
